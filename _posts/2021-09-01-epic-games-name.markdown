Last night while playing Fortnite I received an email from Epic announcing that they had initiated a username change for my account, either because I had requested it, or I was found in violation of their username policies.

After thoroughly checking the validity of the email, to ensure it wasn't phishing, I figured out that someone must have reported my name as a violation. After logging in I saw that my username had been changed to User-somethingsomethingsomething. 

A few keystrokes later and my username was set back to TheTrashman.com

## Long live the TheTrashman.com
