    "body": "2023/01/25 - Fortnite is a popular online game that combines elements of survival, exploration, and building. To win a game of Fortnite, you will need to master a variety of skills, including building, looting, and combat. Here is a basic tutorial on how to play Fortnite and increase your chances of winning.    Learn the controls: Before you start playing, familiarize yourself with the game’s controls so that you can move and interact with the environment effectively.     Gather resources: Fortnite is all about survival, and that means gathering resources. You can chop down trees and mine rocks to gather wood, stone, and metal, which you can use to build structures and weapons.     Build structures: Building is an essential part of Fortnite, as it allows you to protect yourself from enemy fire and gain a tactical advantage. You can build walls, ramps, and other structures to create cover and make it harder for enemies to get to you.     Loot: As you explore the map, you will come across various buildings, vehicles, and other structures that you can loot for weapons, ammo, and other useful items. Be sure to check everything you come across to increase your chances of finding useful items.     Combat: Combat is a crucial part of Fortnite, and you’ll need to master the game’s weapons and combat mechanics to have a chance at winning. Try to aim for headshots, and be mindful of your ammo count.     Survive the storm: The storm in Fortnite is a dangerous force that will shrink the playable area of the map over time. Keep an eye on the storm and make sure you’re in a safe location when it closes in.     Play with a team: Playing with a team can be a big advantage in Fortnite, as you can work together to gather resources, build structures, and take out enemies.     Practice, practice, practice: To improve your skills and increase your chances of winning, you’ll need to practice as much as you can. The more you play, the better you will become.  Remember to always be aware of your surroundings and try different strategies. With time and practice, you will be able to improve your skills and increase your chances of winning. "

You see, TheTrashman wants to add money to his wallet, so little trashy can purchase Fortnite skins, but Playstation makes it nearly impossible. TM has reached out to Playstation multiple times to try to get transactions to go through, usually when TM reaches out it starts to work on the web. Yesterday, the Playstation customer support rep suggested trying on the console. TM wasn’t thrilled at this suggestion, but tried it anyways. Sure enough, both attempted transactions went through fine on the Console. So if you’re struggling to try to purchase any games, or add funds, to your Playstation account, try it on the console instead of on the web. Doing some request/response inspection, TM was able to determine that for some reason Playstation was declining the web transactions for failing some fraud checks. The question is why? The cards are TMs, have been used before, hell even PayPal was failing the same. Why would you ever expect the web to work? (FYI Playstation’s website sucks) "
